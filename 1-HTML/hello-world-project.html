    <p>
      Earth is the third planet in order of distance from the Sun and the
      largest of the terrestrial planets in the solar system , both by mass and
      by diameter . On its surface, there is water , present in all three states
      of aggregation ( solid , liquid and gaseous ) and an atmosphere mainly
      composed of nitrogen and oxygen which, together with the magnetic field
      that surrounds the planet, protects the Earth from cosmic rays and
      fromsolar radiation . As the only planetary body in the solar system
      capable of supporting life as conceived and known by humans , it is the
      only place where all known living species live.
