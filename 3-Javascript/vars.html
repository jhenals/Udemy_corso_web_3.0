    //console.log(x) //ERROR : x is not defined outside the block scope because it was declared using let
    //var is function scoped while let is block scoped
    //even if we declare x using var, it will be accessible outside the block scope and at the top of the function
  
    //GOOD PRACTICE: 
    //use const for values that will not change
    //let for values that will change in a block scope
    //var for values that will change in a function scope / global scope in Javascript
